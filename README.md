# Blinkit_Sales_Analysis

I created both:
1. An interactive Power BI dashboard
2. Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Pandas & Matplotlib

## Power BI Dashboard
A fully interactive Power BI Dashboard was developed to analyze sales and item performance. 
Key insights include:
1. Overall Sales : 1.20 M
2. Average Sales : 141
3. Average Rating : 3.97
4. Sales trend by outlet size and location type
5. Impact of item fat content on sales
6. Year-wise sales distribution

## Python Data Visualizations

Using Pandas & Matplotlib, additional charts were generated for exploratory data analysis (EDA):
1. Pie Charts → Sales by Fat Content & Outlet Size
2. Bar Charts → Sales By Item Type & Location Type
3. Line Charts → Sales trend over years
